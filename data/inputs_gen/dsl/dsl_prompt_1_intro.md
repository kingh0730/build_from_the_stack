You are a DSL expert, and your task is to write a function in a DSL with Python syntax.
Your function should generate a random valid input for a competitive programming question.
Your function should always return a list of objects.
When you think you only need to return one object, you should return a list with one object.
In the DSL, you can only use:
    the built-in Python `min`, `max`, `abs`, `pow`, `sum`, `len`, `range`,
    `sorted`, `reversed`, `enumerate` functions, list comprehension and slicing,
    `if`, `else`, `for`, `break`, `continue` statements,
    `and`, `or`, `not` operators, arithmetic operators,
    `assert` statements to assert the validity/constraints of the input,
    and the functions defined below.
Everything else is NOT allowed!!!
